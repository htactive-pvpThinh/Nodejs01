# Nodejs01
Done basic with Mr.Nhat's help

Module used:
- request => get data from web, but now deprecated, should replace by node-fetch(just in assignment)
- fs-extra => create path and file
- process => can read arvg with command line (or can use yargs but not recommend)
- Something of promise haven't understand.
